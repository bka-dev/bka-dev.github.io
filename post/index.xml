      <description>How to execute operating system commands by leveraging legitimate functions of Mozilla Firefox.
Software environments in which users should only be able to perform a limited amount of tasks often use Kiosk applications to reduce the opportunities of a user to interact with the system. In many environments, only a few pre-defined applications are published to the user, like web browsers or POS software, depending on what the user needs to do.</description>

      <title>Network Security Implications of Host Models</title>

      <description>This blog post is about a concept in network stacks called &amp;ldquo;Host Model&amp;rdquo; and its implications on network security.
It is important for both, the offensive and the defensive side to know the differences between the host model paradigms and to be aware of the defaults that are used in common operating systems.
In this blog post the following 2 hosts will be considered:
Host A
eth0 IPv4 address: 192.168.100.1/24 MAC: 00:0C:29:6D:57:01 eth1 IPv4 Address: 10.</description>

      <description>Changing the MAC address of a network interface can be a common task if you either change addresses for privacy reasons or if you&#39;re performing security assessments.
If you&#39;re using a Linux-based operating system, this can be done using one of the following commands:
ifconfig eth0 hw ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
macchanger-ng --mac xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx eth0
ip link set eth0 address xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
While these changes are only temporary, it&#39;s also possible to instruct the operating system to set the MAC address straight after booting, for example by modifying files like /etc/network/interfaces.</description>
